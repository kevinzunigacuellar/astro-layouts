# astro-layouts

This remark plugin helps you define **folder-based** and **default** layouts to your `md` and `mdx` files in Astro ðŸŽ‰!

## Installation

Install the package using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install astro-layouts
```

## Getting started

Add the plugin to your `astro.config.mjs` file:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import astroLayouts from "astro-layouts";

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      [
        astroLayouts,
        {
          // add your options here
          default: "/src/layouts/Layout.astro",
          blog: "/src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro",
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
});
```

## Options API

### `default`

The `default` key is used to define a default layout for all your files.

```js
{
  default: "/src/layouts/Layout.astro",
}
```

### Other options

The options object can have any other key, which will be used to define a layout for a specific folder or subfolder.

- The `key` is the folder or subfolder path in pages.
- The `value` is the path to the layout file.

```js
{
  blog: "/src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro",
  "products/foo": "/src/layouts/ProductLayout.astro",
  default: "/src/layouts/Layout.astro",
}
```

> **Note**
> All files will inherit layouts from their the closest parent directory that has a layout defined.
> For example, using the configuration above, the file `pages/blog/foo/bar.md` will use the layout defined in `blog`.

### Overriding layouts

You can override any layout defined in the `astro.config.mjs` file by adding a `layout` property to the frontmatter of your file.

```md
# pages/blog/b.md
---
layout: /src/layouts/Custom.astro
---
This page is now using the `Custom.astro` layout instead of the `BlogLayout.astro` layout.
```
